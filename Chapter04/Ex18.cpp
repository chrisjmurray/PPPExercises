// Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of 
// the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
// If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, 
// do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary 
// before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve 
// it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two 
// solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.
